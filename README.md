Welcome to Cat Fighter, a game where you and a friend are both cats, except you are fighting in the street! Use the same computer to play each other (think Fireboy and Watergirl, but competitive). The goal of this game is to hit your opponent until their health bar (pictured at the top) runs out. Whoever successfully depletes their opponent's health bar first wins! 

Setup:
Download Assets, then copy the playme.py code into VS code. You must already have VS, python, and pygame downloaded. 

Controls:
Player 1 (red bandana cat) uses the following setup
1 2
   W
 A  S  D

1 and 2 are attack buttons. S blocks an attack. W, A, and D move you up, left, and right respectively. 

Player 2 (no bandana cat) uses the arrow keys, as well as . and / mimicing the same shape function as Player 1.
