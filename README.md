Hello!!! This is Summer. I downloaded Anaconda, which we can use Spyder through. According to the interwebs, this should be the best way to design for our purposes. Once I have the main loop generated, I will put it in repository!

Hi its Mahnoor, tried using VS Code but it was giving error while installing. So also downloaded anaconda which will help keep the design consistent :)
